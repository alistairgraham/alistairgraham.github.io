    <h2>Information about site</h2>
    <p>The Danger Zone website was made to make New Zealanders feel safer about tsunamiâ€™s after an earthquake. The website collects real-time data from Geonet about earthquakes and displays that data on the google maps API to give the user a feeling of safety after an earthquake. The point of the website is to show the user if they are safe from a tsunami after an earthquake and if not, it shows the user the nearest safe zone. <br>
    It was made as part of the Summer of Tech Create Camp hosted by Flux to make a project based around an API or dataset.
